    "In this tutorial, you will be creating a classifcation model. The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Apply what you have learnt and come up with the optimal model to predict if a company goes bankrupt or not. \n",

    " PS: If you find a technique/method that you believe was not shared in class but useful; you can and should use it. No points will be deducted for trying! Do not delete your trial scripts, these will be important for you to understand where you improved from your previous attempts.\n",
